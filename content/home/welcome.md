**Pivot Lab** was established at HUST, 2021. Our members consist of self-motivated students from different information disciplines at HUST from ECE/CS/AIA department, aiming to build an interest-driven research group especially for undergradutes.

Our Lab consists of two SIGs(Special Interest Group): 

1. SIGAI: AI related research & techniques, now including SLAM, Robotic Vision and AutoML
2. SIGSYS: computer systems related research, including Distributed Database, GPU Achitecture, Privacy & Security et al.
