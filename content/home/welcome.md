        **Pivot Lab** was established at HUST, 2021. Our members consist of self-motivated students from different
        information disciplines at HUST from ECE/CS/AIA department, aiming to build an interest-driven research group
        especially for undergradutes.

        Our Lab consists of several SIGs(Special Interest Group) and driven by our UG members and advisors(usually
        senior students or experienced graduates). We continue to explore the frontiers in computer science and make
        things happen!
