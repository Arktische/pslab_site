We receive fudings from Tencent and will co-build educational open-sourced project named tinyRPC. This project is mainly led by [Yuxing Tu](https://uring.cc). You can view it on [github](https://github.com/Arktische/tinyRPC). Any contributions are welcomed. We are actively finding potential collaborators and open to any advice on promoting this educational project.
